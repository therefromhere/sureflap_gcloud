# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#

# First ignore everything
.*

# Now include the files we want
!requirements.txt
!main.py
!sureflap_gcloud/*.py

# Ignore these others
tests/*

# Explicitly allow current dir. `gcloud deploy` fails without it.
